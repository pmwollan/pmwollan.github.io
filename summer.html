    <h3>Summer</h3>
<p>Summer, warmest season of the year, between spring and autumn. In the Northern Hemisphere, it is usually defined as the period between the summer solstice, June 21 or 22, and the autumnal equinox (day and night equal in length), September 22 or 23.

<h3>Weather</h3>

The temperature contrast between summer and the other seasons exists only in middle and high latitudes; temperatures in the equatorial regions generally vary little from month to month. A period of exceptionally hot weather, often with high humidity, during the summer is called a heat wave.
    </p>

<h3>Sports</h3>
    <p>
        Usually summer sports include track and field, baseball, swimming, beach volleyball, and soccer.
