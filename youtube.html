    <h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com">Youtube.com,</a></h3>
        <p>  is a great website that is visited by many daily. Again, I really like the simplicity of the website and that they include things that are reccomended based on what you have recently watched or things that many around the world are watching. They have links to all of the videos that pop up when you first open the website and an option for you to save the video so you can watch later. This website is a lot different because you can basically search anything you can think of on this website unlike a clothing website. Once you are watching the video that you came to the website for there are many more options shown in the column on the far right based on what you are currently watching. The coding for this website is a lot of things that are not familiar to me. They included a lot of copyrights and have the element g in there for a majority of the time. There are so many numbers included in elements and I have no idea what they mean. I hope who/whomeever did the coding for Youtube gets paid a lot of money. I do not see any tables and I really don't see a lot of things that we have learned in this class. The layout does make sense to me because there are videos that are reccommended to me based on things I have recently watched. They also include other selling points such as Youtube TV which I did not know was a thing. There are about 5 columns and a lot of rows of reccomendations. It is very easy to navigate this website mostly because when people go to Youtube they are going there for a specific purpose. The colors are simple but based on their logo, so it makes sense. I like the logo and the use of the logo throughtout the website because it is a play button.
