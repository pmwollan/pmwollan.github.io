    <p> is a very bad website. I do not like anything about this website. First problem, it is in a different language. There are pictures everywhere and it is so busy looking. There is no organization at all and is very hard to know what you are looking at. To look at the items listed you have to scroll horizontally. And the sizes are all different. You can barely see the search bar and the sizing is all off. The coding is definitley not clean. The only element they are using is div and it is really hard to follow what each element does. They are using HTML5 elements and inside every div is a table. That is how they listed all of the items, was in a table. The main thing that does not make sense about this website is the layout. There is no real layout all of the images of products are just scattered everywhere accross the page. There are too many columns but they are all spread out so it is mostly just a lot of tables. The website scrolls left to right. The navigation is very confusing but it probably doesn't help that I can't read anything on this website. There are too many colors. Each link it a different color and there is a different color for almost all of the tables and their information. It could match their product because all of these things can come in different colors but overall, it is confusing. The layout is pretty simple they didn't try hard to make it look interesting but they have some gifs which is a cool touch. There is no white space used. Overall there really isn't anything good about this website and not much effort put in to the look of it.
