    <p> is a great website. I really like that the website include the sales of the day in bright colors and it is the very first thing that you see. The graphics describe what the link will take you to which makes it easier to navigate. The website is pretty simple looking but I think that they make the pictures of their clothing stand out which will make the customers want to look at the products. The coding is clean and modern they are using HTML5 elements. They have things that I have seen before in this class which is surprising. They are using DIV elements and lists. They do not use any tables but it does validate. I really enjoy the simplicity of this website and the fact that there is not a ton of color because that kind of represents their brand. Simple style clothing. The layout does make sense to me because all of the different navigations are stacked on top of each other in a block style this makes it easier to see all of the different options that the user has. It is laid out in a 2 colum style and there is no scrolling effect. They do have a hover effect where the picture changes when you hover over it. This website is not confusing to navigate. They use the color effectively and their new and on sale product is emphasized. The little animations that this website has goes along with the simple style of the website. The Urban Outfitters logo changes its look which makes it pop.  </p>
