<p>As you navigate through this website I hope you learn more about the four different seasons and what they have to offer such as weather, activities, sports etc.

<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>
The Earth's axis is slightly tilted in relation to its orbit around the Sun. This is why we have seasons.
How exactly do seasons work?
In most cultures, including all western countries, the year is commonly divided into four seasons:
Spring
Summer
Fall or Autumn
Winter
    </p>

<h3>Astronomical Seasons</h3>
    <p><img src=solstice.png class="solstice">
The astronomical definition uses the dates of equinoxes and solstices to mark the beginning and end of the seasons:
Spring begins on the spring equinox;
Summer begins on the summer solstice;
Fall (autumn) begins on the fall equinox; and
Winter begins on the winter solstice.
The beginning of each season marks the end of the last.
Because the timings of the equinoxes and solstices change each year, the length of astronomical seasons within a year and between years also vary.
